            At OllyGarden, we're on a mission to cultivate the most efficient telemetry pipelines, helping companies grow their observability practices organically. Like a skilled gardener, we empower observability engineers with tools to harvest insights from their telemetry dataâ€”helping them prune costs, nurture operations, and guide their software engineering peers toward sustainable growth.

          <p className="text-olly-white/90 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
            We're planting the seeds of a diverse, multidisciplinary, and remote team that transforms raw telemetry into flourishing intelligence. Join us and help our customers' monitoring systems blossom into actionable insights.
